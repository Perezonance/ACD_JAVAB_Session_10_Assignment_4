First, The GROUP BY clause is used to group rows into aggregated "summary" rows that have equal values. For instanc eyou would use it
   to return the amount of clients per city in a DB: 
   
                SELECT COUNT(exampledb.client_id), client_city 
                FROM exampledb 
                GROUP BY client_city;
              
The HAVING clause is used to apply an additional argument or condition to the selected set which generally has been grouped. More important,
however, the HAVING clause allows us to utilize functions for conditions as opposed to the WHERE clause:

                SELECT COUNT(exampledb.client_id), client_city 
                FROM exampledb GROUP BY client_city 
                HAVING COUNT(exampledb.client_id > 5);
                
Finally, the ORDER BY clause is just used to sort the result set by ascending or descending order:

                SELECT COUNT(exampledb.client_id), client_city 
                FROM exampledb 
                GROUP BY client_city 
                HAVING COUNT(exampledb.client_id > 5) 
                ORDER BY COUNT(exampledb.client_id) DESC;
